<p style="{{page.p-style}}">We're excited to share the new features we've been working on for the last month!</p>

<p style="{{page.p-style}}">We've updated our design for <b>permission summaries</b> and we added a brand new UI to view your datasets and dynamically generate lists of <b>high utilizers</b>! You can access the high utilizers UI through the Actions Menu for any <a href="https://thedataloom.com/gallery/#/entitysets/2cb51b29-b06e-4760-973a-aa664ee70538">newly integrated datasets</a>.</p>

<p style="{{page.p-style}}">Our new graph engine is also complete and allows you to easily navigate through large complex datasets. Just click on a person in your dataset and either view their basic details at the top of the page or scroll down for a timeline of information that the person was associated with.</p>

<p style="{{page.p-style}}">And it doesn't stop there. You can even click on one of the associated events to view more details about the event. Who else has a jail booking record for that day? What other locations are associated with this case?</p>
